    "The question about the appropriateness can be answered with \"No!\". It is much like with the term \"rocket science\".

    "## What even _are_ computers? The early days\n",
    "\n",
    "Early computer science of course had to study computers, because at first, **nobody knew what a computer should or could be**. During this process nobody referred to this as computer science yet, of course! People like Alan Turing had to come up with abstract concepts like an \"a-machine\", that were based on things everybody knew a computing device should be able to do. But nobody knew if that was _all_, or if they were missing something. It turns out, all attempts ([so far](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church%E2%80%93Turing_thesis)) lead to an equally powerful notion of computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "When people constructed the first practical computing machines, there were a lot of \"computer science\" (CS) questions beyond mechanical and electrical engineering. The better and faster computers got and the more normal the experience of working with a computer became, the more natural CS questions arose: How can more users use the same machine at the same time? How can we prevent different users' programs from interfering with each other? How to manage the memory efficiently? How to store and process data? **In that time, CS _was_ caring a lot about computers and how to run them**.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, computers are universal computing machines. So their whole point is to *solve arbitrary problems*.\n",

    "      * it also happens the other way around - fields like Bio* are very good at dealing with complexity, without assuming they even can observe all the data. That is why their surveys over methods, which read like pure CS papers mostly, are usually better than their counterparts in the CS community.\n",

    "## The spirits that have been summoned\n",
    "\n",
    "The fact that CS is such a generic problem solver leads many computer scientists to having to deal with all-too-human problems, inadvertently. For example, the Unicode consortium (see [episode three](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/w3ct2g98) of \"Two Smiley Faces\" by the BBC Documentary podcast), that deals with standardization of text encoding, as described by Keith Winstein:\n",
    "\n",
    "> I mean the people on that committee are people like me - they are experts in the encoding of information. And this has nothing to do with the encoding of information. **Asking me whether or not _Yerba Mate_ is more important than _menstruation_, or more popular, or whether people would or would not want to express these concepts, you know, that's not a technical question. It's not a question that someone like me should be answering** - no committee. Especially with some of the absurd matters they've had to decide: Like someone proposed a Brontosaurus emoji. And you know, I guess it is controversial in Paleontology whether Brontosaurus really existed or not, or is it just a species of a Pattosaurus. And I guess people still don't know. A committee of text encoding engineers is not qualified to answer this question.\n",
    "\n",
    "And the fact that computers are good at keeping track of reality, very fast, cheaply, and accurately (given someone wrote and implemented a good set of requirements), many want to and do use them to implement a \"digital twin\" of some part of human reality. That allows easy access to, and manipulation of, a powerful representation of more and more of human reality. That makes computer scientists the **forgers of power**. And [with great power comes great responsibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/With_great_power_comes_great_responsibility), although, of course, computer scientists are not necessarily the _wielders_ of said power. They certainly _can_ be (\"I read your email\" being the unofficial motto of the IT administrators' guild). But in my experience, more often than not, computer scientists are more driven by the pursuit of truth, challenges, and aesthetics, rather than power.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, even if a powerful algorithm will be put in responsible hands only, the question remains: Is it safe on its own? Implementing a powerful algorithm is like building a nuclear power plant. Even if you can be sure that it will never get in the hands of nefarious agents, it is an inherently dangerous thing. In the case of nuclear power, because you have to control a would-be run-away process. In the case of algorithms, you have to control emergence from complexity.

    "Most experiments in computer science are answering questions that may be phrased as \"how well does algorithm X solve problem Y\"{% fn 1 %}? \n",

    " \n",
    "There is not much epistomology going on. Everything is \"right there\". That misleads a lot of researchers into thinking they can understand everything. And the low humility leads them to being sloppy. And the CS community even forgoes much of the advantage of doing \"in silico\" experiments by not sharing their code and other artifacts, because the incentives are not right for that. I will admit that I have not done that either, during my PhD studies.\n",

    "\n",
    "When you step into the lecture hall, seminar room or lab of any scientific field, you gain the impression that the aim is to create an army of scientists, even when the majority of graduates will not end up working as a scientist. I did not get this impression in CS education. Computer science is just too damn practical. Physicists are usually not hired for their specific knowledge or abilities to solve particular kinds of equations. You hire the general analytic skill, the rigour, and the frustration tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "CS education, on the other hand is encroached by three horsemen: Computer affine subcultures, the industry, and \"technology\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Who enters the field\n",
    "\n",
    "CS freshmen are of course a very diverse demographic. However, it is also not a random sample from the general population of the same age. Many find their first interest in computers and coding from enabling their own hobbies, like gaming. In the 2000s that meant that you had to become quite intimate with your computer, to get the most out of this hobby. Nowadays gaming consoles, and even smart phones are perfect gardens of gaming experiences. I will not pretend as if I hadn't completely lost touch, but I would be surprised if anyone still had to dig into their computer hardware or software to get some game running. I am sure people still do, but I assume today much less people will. So actually today the incentives to study CS may have shifted _away_ from spending more time with a pleasure machine, but at the same time, freshmen are less experience with breaking and fixing a computing machine - again, this is only my assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Who is poaching from the field\n",
    "\n",
    "More and more industries cannot get enough developers, and are willing to pay good money and tolerate quirky personalities in the process. That is a powerful drive to end an academic CS career in favour of making money, that is maybe not as present in core scientific fields. At the same time, many potential employers are not waiting for hardcore computer scientists that dream in data structures, but just need their new web site coded. So when a CS student today talks about a \"stack\" it is likely they refer to something like MERN, and not to LIFO, or OSI. Of course there _is_ also demand for specialized CS experts that don't shy away from dry and intimidating topics, e.g., in information security.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is the craze of the day\n",
    "\n",
    "And finally, the field suffers from the constant firehose of new languages, frameworks, devices, that demand \"training\", rather than education and research. When any student \"uses a library\", you assume they are spending quality time with some dead trees. A CS student \"using a library\" is more likely to call external code from theirs. This is not their fault, but it certainly distracts from the core principles of your field, when much of what you do in your practical work is googling some API, or hunting down some error caused by a breaking change, instead of pondering some paradox, wrapping your head around the correctness proof of an algorithm.\n",
